PART 1 LESSON 2 : Introduction to Operating Systems
***************************************************
V1 : This lesson covers High level overview of OS and hardware abstraction.

V2: Visual Metophor of Toy Shop, Uses three basic comparisions
    1. Direct Operational Resouces to control use of available resources like cpu, memory and peripheral devices.
    2. Enforce fair, safe and clean working policies
    3. Mitigate complexity of difficult tasks using system calls

V3: What is an Operating System?
    It is the software that operates on underlying system directly and provide following services.
    1. Hides the hardware complexity from app developers & users. Indeed app developers no need to worry about the underlying hardware rather they can focus on how to use services provided by OS.
    2. It manages and control the availabe resouces for single or multiple applications running on the system.
    3. OS helps in isolation and protection of resouces while running multiple applications. 

V6: Abstraction vs Arbitration of OS
    Abstraction : Hiding hardware complexity and provide simplified services
    Arbitration : Managing the available resources to avoid dispute among applications.

V7 : Operating System Examples
     Desktop : MS Windows, Unix - Mac OS X (Berkley System Distribution, BSD unix kernel), Linux ...
     Embedded : Android, ios, symbian ...
     This whole series of video lectures focus on Linux OS.
